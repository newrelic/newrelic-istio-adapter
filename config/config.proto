      // cumulative tally of occurrences since the beginning of
      // measurements. Rather, this metric type represents the change in the
      // cumulative tally of events within a time window.
      //
      // For example, this metric type would be used to record:
      //

      // event values, sum of event values, and the minimum and maximum
      // event values observed within a time window.
      //
      // For example, this metric type would be used to record:
      //
      //  * the duration and count of requests to service
      //  * the duration and count of database transactions
      //  * the time each message spent in a queue
